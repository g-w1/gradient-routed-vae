# Gradient Routed VAE

Please see [this blog post](https://jacobgw.com/blog/ml/2024/12/12/interp-latent.html) for an explanation and see [here](https://jacobgw.com/gradient-routed-vae/) for a demo.

I created a variational autoencoder with a super interpretable latent space using [gradient routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04332v1)!
